            <p>The 29th Annual Hedgelaying Competition will be held on 28 February 2026 from 10am until 4pm at
              Atherfield Farm, by kind permission of Mrs Annie Henton and Mr & Mrs R Chapman.</p>
            <p>The venue is Atherfield Farm, Atherfield Road, PO38 2LF. <a
                href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/urFTFvmXZHQeP8Si7">Directions</a></p>
            <p>W3W: <a href="https://w3w.co/croaking.jacket.snoring">///croaking.jacket.snoring</a></p>
            <p>Parking will be available on the farm but the ground is likely to be wet, so please drive sensibly for
              the conditions and only bring vehicles on site that can safely get on and off a field. Bring suitable
              footwear and clothing appropriate for the weather.</p>
            <p>There is half price ferry travel for all 2026 competitors, thanks to our sponsor Wightlink Ferries. If
              you're based on the mainland and travelling by ferry to enter the 2026 competition, contact us now to get
              your 50% discount voucher - valid for vehicles and passengers on any qualifying Wightlink crossing.</p>


            <h3>What's on</h3>
            <p>
              The site is open to spectators from 9:30, with competitors typically assembling around 9:45 and working
              through the day until 3pm. Judging usually finishes after 3pm; to see the final results we'd suggest
              arriving before 2pm if you have limited time.

              Tractor and Engine Club.

                  <p>
                    The competition is held at a different site around the Island each year. The format is usually
                    similar. You'll be outdoors in a field, but don't worry, the tea tent provides food and shelter.

                  <p>
                    Parking is usually on a grassy field and may be wet or muddy. Bring suitable footwear and a vehicle
                    that can safely access a field. There may be a short walk from parking to the site.
