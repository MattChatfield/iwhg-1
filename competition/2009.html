                            <h2>2009 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 2009 competition was held on <strong>Saturday 28 February 2009</strong> at Dunsbury
                                Farm, Brook by kind permission of Mr &amp; Mrs P Seeley.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Dunsbury Farm, Brook</p>
                        <p><a href="http://ventnorblog.com/isle-of-wight-hedgelaying-competition/">Coverage in Ventnor
                                Blog</a></p>

                        <p>The competition's return to Dunsbury Farm was a hugely popular choice, with the stunning
                            views across the sea to Dorset forming the backdrop to what was one of the more memorable
                            competitions in recent years.</p>

                        <p>Once more the entry numbers hit record highs, with the entire length of hedge laid throughout
                            the day — not a single stem was left standing by the competitors, who cut eighteen pitches
                            between them. Additionally there was once more a demonstration pitch by Peter Tunks, a
                            former supreme national champion who this year chose to lay in Midlands style, which
                            generated much interest as this style is hardly known on the Island.</p>

                        <p>Other attractions included a demonstration of hurdle-making from local hurdle-maker Richard
                            Bolwell, and the usual impressive display of billhooks. The crowd assembled at 15:30 to hear
                            the results, and once more judges Paul Sivell and Alan Ashby kept the punters in suspense as
                            they went back to review their marks on more than one occasion before they finally emerged
                            from their huddle.</p>

                        <p>Some surprises were in store as former novice champion Rob Richards was promoted this year to
                            the Open class, and in this, his first ever Open event managed to tie for fourth place with
                            former champion Dick Pulleine. Long-standing competitor Tom Murphy of Living Landscapes
                            improved on his previous year's performance to take a respectable third place, whilst the
                            top slots were taken by the two National Trust wardens; Sean Adams being just beaten by
                            reigning Open champion Paul Davis.</p>

                        <p>In the Novice class, Isle of Wight Council countryside ranger Rick Temple made a remarkable
                            leap from 5th place in 2008 to lift the Mary Sitch Novice cup. The judges pointed out how
                            very close this class was, with runners up Paul Trickett and Alex Holmes being only one and
                            two points behind respectively.</p>
