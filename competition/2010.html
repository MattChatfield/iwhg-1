                            <p>The 2010 competition was held on <strong>Saturday 27 February 2010</strong> at Kings
                                Manor Farm, Freshwater by kind permission of Mr and Mrs J Sheldon.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Isle of Wight Council; West Wight
                            Landscape Partnership; IW AONB; Hants &amp; IW Wildlife Trust</p>

                        <p>The wide drive that sweeps down to the historic farmhouse at Kings Manor Farm in Freshwater
                            is lined with hedges planted in 2001, which are now coming up to a suitable size to be laid
                            for the first time. So at the invitation of landowners Mr and Mrs Sheldon the IW Hedgelaying
                            Competition was held at Kings Manor on Saturday 27 February. The competition not only
                            boasted its largest ever number of entrants - 24 pitches - but also the first mainland
                            entrants were warmly welcomed by the locals. Wolverhampton-based hedgelayer John Dunbar
                            traveled down the enter the competition, and a team was entered from mainland-based charity
                            the Peoples Trust for Endangered Species - although as a major Island landowner they are no
                            strangers to the island's hedges and woods.</p>

                                        <span class="image left"><img src="../images/gallery/dyson1.jpg"
                alt="Karl Dyson" /></span>

                        <p>The competition was lively, with a number of new faces in the ranks as well as some with
                            points to prove from previous years! In the Team class the notorious 'Wench layers' returned
                            for their fourth consecutive attempt to lift the trophy, and finally found success, taking
                            first place with a massive 15 points over the second placed Isle of Wight College (1) team.
                            Last year's Novice class winner Richard Temple successfully defended his title, with last
                            year's team winner Peter Smith taking second by four points. More interesting was the glut
                            of newcomers further down the class. Perhaps these were encouraged by the training session
                            held a few weeks prior to the competition, sponsored by the West Wight Landscape
                            Partnership. If these novices keep up their craft the influx of new hedgelayers certainly
                            bodes well for future competitions.</p>

                        <p>The class that everybody was watching was the Open, as last year's champion Paul Davis chose
                            not to defend his title, leaving the class wide open. Mainlander John Dunbar was an unknown
                            quantity as nobody had seen his work before, and a few of the local competitors could be
                            seen giving Mr Dunbar's hedge very careful study. But as it turned out it was the local
                            hedgelayers who took the top places, with Oz Hoskyns returning to form and taking third
                            place, separated only by the judge's decision from Tom Murphy who took fourth place with the
                            same score. In second place, as in 2009, Sean Adams once more showed himself to be one of
                            the Island's best hedgelayers - this time leading third and fourth place by a single point.
                            But to great applause from the spectators the overall winner, by a single point, was
                            announced as competition stalwart Rob Richards, who not only took the Open trophy for the
                            first time but also retained the Hand Tools trophy, having used hand tools throughout.</p>
