                            <h2>2012 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 2012 competition was held on <strong>Saturday 25 February 2012</strong> at New Barn
                                Farm, Calbourne by kind permission of Mr Chris Spence.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Isle of Wight Council; W Hurst &amp; Sons
                            Ltd; IW AONB; Hants &amp; IW Wildlife Trust</p>

                        <p>The competition was held on a fine, mild day, which presented spectacular views north from
                            New Barn Farm over the Solent to the New Forest throughout the day. The hedge was young, and
                            although it had already been laid once the man who planted it in 1988 visited the site
                            during the day to see how his handiwork was holding up! The fine weather meant that a great
                            number of spectators turned up to enjoy the day, and the lively atmosphere and warm
                            temperatures meant that this was a very enjoyable day.</p>

                        <p>Nineteen pitches were cut by a total of thirty-five competitors, plus a demonstration plot
                            cut by former supreme national champion Peter Tunks, who drew attention with his usual
                            impressive annual display of craftsmanship. There were some familiar faces amongst the
                            competitors and also some new ones. Three mainland entrants had crossed the water to join in
                            the Novice class, more than ever before. There was also the welcome return of Paul Sivell,
                            who has been involved in the competition for many years, including a stint as a judge. Paul
                            entered the Open class for the first time in some years. Also in the Open was another
                            competition veteran, Alex Holmes, who was last year's Novice champion and this year moved up
                            to the Open for the first time. Former champion Rob Richards was taking a break from the
                            competition, but turned up to support the competitors. With seven team entrants there was
                            strong competition in the Team class, even though the Isle of Wight College only entered two
                            teams this year.</p>

                        <p>The judges commented that the entrants were of good standard, and particularly in the Novice
                            class they marked it very closely, with only five points separating the champion from 7th
                            place. For the first time a class was won by a mainland competitor, with Hampshire man Hans
                            E. Taylor winning the Mary Sitch Novice Cup. The top places in the team class were also
                            keenly fought, with the Isle of Wight Green Gym taking third place only a single point
                            behind the 'Bouldnor Boys', a duo led by former Novice champion Richard Temple. Winners in
                            the Team class were father and son team, 'Big Cook, Little Cook'. James and Josh Cook.</p>

                        <p>With Rob Richards absent from the Open class and Paul Sivell returning, it was hard to
                            predict the results. As it turned out, last year's champion successfully defended his title,
                            and Tom Murphy lifted the AONB Trophy again, with Oz Hoskyns once more coming a close
                            second. Former Novice champion Alex Holmes placed a very credible fourth, just behind Paul
                            Sivell who took a comfortable third place.</p>
