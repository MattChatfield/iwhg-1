                            <h2>2013 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 2013 competition was held on <strong>Saturday 23 February 2013</strong> at Dunsbury
                                Farm, Brook by kind permission of Mr and Mrs P Seely.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Isle of Wight Council; W Hurst &amp; Sons
                            Ltd; IW AONB; Hants &amp; IW Wildlife Trust</p>

                        <p>After the original competition site at Bathingbourne was washed out the event returned for an
                            unprecedented third time to Dunsbury Farm, Brook, where Mr and Mrs Patrick Seely hosted the
                            2013 competition. The site was dry and easy to walk on, a great improvement on some of the
                            wetter fields used in previous years, and of course the famous Dunsbury views across the
                            coast were to hand. So the twenty-four hedgelayers who gathered to test their skills against
                            each other quickly felt at home at Dunsbury.</p>

                        <p>Before the competition began, judge Richard Grogan explained that this year, a new scoring
                            sheet was to be used with greater emphasis on the quality of the workmanship. This led to
                            some speculation as to whether the new system might cause some changes in the chances of
                            various entrants, but the new scheme was welcomed by the competitors. A few flurries of snow
                            blew across the downland, and the weather was very cold, although dry and sometimes sunny.
                            The hedgelayers were undeterred, and sustained by hot tea and bacon rolls from the tea tent.
                        </p>

                        <p>With only four team entrants the team class was keenly fought, with the home team from
                            Dunsbury Farm bringing off a spectacular victory, having placed 6th in the last two
                            competitions they had entered. The Dunsbury team had clearly been doing some practice, and
                            it paid off as they lifted the Team trophy for the first time.</p>

                        <p>The novice class featured three mainland contestants, including defending champion Hans
                            Taylor from Hampshire, who was unexpectedly beaten into fourth place. The new Novice
                            champion was Jim Clinton, who beat Nat Purcell by a single point.</p>

                        <p>In the Open class, Tom Murphy of Living Landscapes was defending his trophy once more, and
                            all eyes were on Whitwell's Oz Hoskyns, who had come a close second to Tom for two
                            consecutive years, after placing higher than him in 2010. Would 2013 be the year Oz finally
                            lifted the cup? It was not to be, and Tom was champion once more, beating his rival by an
                            unequivocal 11 points. Third was Ric Temple, with competition veterans Dick Pulleine and
                            Alex Holmes placing fourth and fifth respectively.</p>
