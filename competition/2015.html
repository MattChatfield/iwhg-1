                            <h2>2015 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 2015 competition was held at Parkdown Barns, Calbourne Road, Newport, PO30 4HP, by
                                kind permission of Mr and Mrs Mike Morris.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Isle of Wight Council; Wight AONB; Hants
                            &amp; IW Wildlife Trust</p>

                        <p>After the cancellation of the 2014 competition there was some concern when the 2015
                            competition site was subjected to a few days of heavy rain. But the Island's hedgelayers
                            were not to be put off for two years in a row, and despite what might best be described as a
                            challenging access route, once the competitors arrived at the competition site, a very nice
                            stretch of hedge set on solid, dry ground proved to be ideally suited for the 2015
                            competition.</p>

                        <p>This year featured an unusually high number of mainland competitors, with some new faces
                            coming to enjoy the competition - and stay over to sample the Island's hospitality of
                            course. It is encouraging to see the competition becoming an attraction in its own right and
                            bringing some business to the Island in the off-season. Despite some poor weather in the
                            morning by the time the judges were inspecting the finished work, the view across to the
                            mainland was clear, and the rain held off long enough for the prize-giving to take place -
                            an event that proved even more exciting than usual.</p>

                        <p>As reigning Open champion Tom Murphy is currently working abroad, he was unable to defend his
                            title and there was the certainty that a new champion would come forward. With newcomer and
                            prize-winning National hedgelayer Russell Woodham in the Open competition, there was a
                            wildcard that nobody was discounting. Would the AONB Open Trophy be won by a mainland
                            hedgelayer for the first time ever? Or would former Champion Dick Pulleine come back to
                            reclaim the trophy he had lifted so many times before? The judges, Alan Ashby and Richard
                            Grogan, gave the pitches their usual careful scrutiny, but the crowd was anxious to know the
                            result. A great cheer went up when the news was announced that the new Open Champion was
                            Whitwell man Oz Hoskyns, who had come second to Tom Murphy in both 2013 and 2012, and has
                            been a regular competitor for over ten years. Second in the Open was Dorset man Russell
                            Woodham, who was laying in South of England style for the first time and made an impressive
                            debut at the competition. Russell said afterwards: "A very good friendly contest, I would
                            recommend a visit. Well done to all who were there. I would like to thank all involved for
                            such a great welcome, help, hospitality, and I'm already looking forward to next year."
                            Third prize went to Dick Pulleine, who was only a point ahead of fourth place Alex Holmes.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Novice class was also certain of a new champion, with 2013 winner Jim Clinton not
                            defending. Mainlander Rob Wood was the winner, with Newchurch-based forestry worker Andy
                            Toms coming in second.</p>

                        <p>The Team class saw the return of Dunsbury Farm, the only trophy-holder to defend their title
                            this year. Alas for them, maybe distracted by celebrity weddings they scraped into fourth
                            place, handing the Landscape Therapy Team Trophy to the 'Island Ploughmen' - a team which
                            included former Open champion Rob Richards who has now completed what is thought to be a
                            unique hat trick by winning the Novice class (2008), the Open class (2010) and now the Team.
