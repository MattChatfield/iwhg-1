                            <h2>2017 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 25th Annual Hedgelaying Competition was held on 25 February 2017 at New Barn Farm,
                                Calbourne by kind permission of Mr Chris Spence.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Wight AONB; Hants &amp; IW Wildlife Trust;
                            Gift to Nature</p>

                        <p>With splendid views across the Solent, the competition was pleased to return to New Barn Farm
                            to finish the hedge that was started in 2012. The weather was cold but fair, and a good,
                            even hedge had been prepared with nineteen pitches laid - one of the biggest competitions in
                            recent years.</p>

                        <p>The Open class had nine entrants, predominantly mainlanders. Last year's only novice (and
                            hence winner) Richard Knowles returned to defend his title against two challengers. Seven
                            teams also took part, marking the continued growth of this class. Some new entrants were
                            welcomed to the competition, especially the IW Young Farmers, and the Hampshire and Isle of
                            Wight Wildlife Trust Woodland Apprentices, who mustered two teams.</p>

                        <p>The competitors put on a good show for the many visitors who came to watch the competition
                            during the day, as well as taking advantage of the excellent tea and cakes provided in the
                            marquee. As usual there was a display of heritage tools from Ralph Griffin, and this year
                            the competition welcomed back a running display of static engines and vehicles from Vectis
                            Vintage Tractors and Engines Club, including the popular steam saw.</p>

                        <p>The judges took a remarkable time to come to a conclusion, and when the scores were revealed
                            it was clear why - only two points separated second and sixth place in the Open, with 2015
                            Novice winner Rob Wood, who was seventh in the Open in 2016, making a huge improvement to
                            take the top spot and the AONB Cup. Second was Garry Moore, with Phil Hart in third place.
                            In the Novice class last year's winner Richard Knowles was beaten back into second place by
                            newcomer Matt Gee. The busy team class saw some very high quality work, with Team Hollis
                            winning the class a full six points ahead of second place Dick Pulleine and Alex Holmes.</p>
