                            <h2>2018 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 26th Annual Hedgelaying Competition was held on 24 February 2018 at Coombe Farm,
                                Brighstone by kind permission of Mr and Mrs James Dawes.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Wight AONB; Pinkeye Graphics Ltd</p>
                        <p><strong>Supporters:</strong> DTM, JMC Hire, W Hurst &amp; Sons</p>

                        <p>On a bitterly cold day the competition was pleased to pay its first visit to the beautiful
                            Coombe Farm, Brighstone. The competitors assembled as the sun shone, giving spectacular
                            views across the village and to the sea beyond. Alongside the tea tent there was a popular
                            running display of static engines and vehicles from Vectis Vintage Tractors and Engines
                            Club; and this year the Vectis Searchers gave an interesting demonstration of metal
                            detecting, showing some previous finds and answering questions about their hobby.</p>

                        <p>With a short hedge this year there was some concern that pitches might be limited, but in the
                            end every entrant on the day was able to compete. The solid hawthorn hedge had a few field
                            maple standards throughout, and most of the competitors, including all the Open class, chose
                            to use powered tools, leaving only three contenders for the W Hurst and Sons Cup for the
                            best hedge laid with hand tools only. Thirteen pitches were cut, with 28 hedgelayers in
                            total, including six teams making up the largest class.</p>

                        <p>As usual the team event was keenly fought, with a range of entrants young and old, including
                            two teams from the Isle of Wight Young Farmers and one from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight
                            Wildlife Trust Woodland Apprentices. The Young Farmers improved hugely on their weak
                            performance last year, with the team led by Will Cross taking the Landscape Therapy Trophy,
                            just ahead of the Wildlife Trust. The home team from Coombe Farm made their debut appearance
                            in the competition, and included landowner James Dawes.</p>

                        <p>For the second consecutive year Matt Gee was the novice winner and won the Mary Sitch Cup;
                            beating runner-up Adam Hurren. Matt also won the W Hurst and Sons cup for the best hedge
                            laid using only hand tools.</p>

                        <p>The Open class had a majority of Island competitors, but it was two mainland guests who made
                            their welcome return to fight out first place. Last year's champion Rob Wood failed by a
                            single point to reclaim his laurels, being beaten into second place by Lewes man Phil Hart
                            who lifted the AONB Cup as the 2018 Open class winner.</p>
