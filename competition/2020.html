                            <h2>2020 Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</h2>
                            <p>The 27th Annual Hedgelaying Competition was held on 29 February 2020 at Coombe Farm,
                                Brighstone by kind permission of Mr and Mrs James Dawes.</p>
                        </header>

                        <p><strong>Lead sponsors:</strong> Landscape Therapy; Wight AONB; Pinkeye Graphics Ltd</p>
                        <p><strong>Supporters:</strong> W Hurst &amp; Sons, Hants and IW Wildlife Trust, Mrs Mary Sitch
                        </p>

                        <p>On a return visit to Coombe Farm, Brighstone, the 27th Annual Isle of Wight Hedgelaying
                            Competition provided its usual combination of traditional craft and skill, keen competition,
                            and excellent refreshments.</p>

                        <p>The weather forecast was dire, but in fact the day turned out to be bright and sunny
                            throughout, with only a stiff breeze to remind visitors of the predicted storm. Twelve
                            pitches were cut during the day, with 21 hedgelayers competing including five teams making
                            up the largest class.</p>

                        <p>Many spectators turned up to enjoy the day, not only enjoying the competition but also other
                            attractions such as the Vectis Searchers metal detecting demonstration, Ralph Griffin's
                            display of billhooks and tools, and the popular running display of static engines and
                            vehicles from Vectis Vintage Tractors and Engines Club.</p>

                        <p>The judges were Alan Ashby, of Tunbridge Wells, and the Island's AONB lead officer, Richard
                            Grogan. At the start of the event organiser Tony Ridd paid tribute to Peter Tunks, former
                            supreme national champion, a regular judge and great supporter of the competition, who died
                            in 2019.</p>

                        <p>The four open competitors fought it out on a separate stretch of hedge on the far side of the
                            field. Defending open champion Phil Hart, from Lewes was pitched against two Island regulars
                            Tom Murphy and Kingsley Hollis, alongside newcomer Matthew Beard from Sussex. In a very
                            closely-scored class, Phil Hart successfully defended his title and lifted the Denis Russell
                            Cup (formerly the AONB Cup) for the second time; beating Tom Murphy into second place by
                            only two points. But Tom had some consolation in not only winning the Peter Tunks £20 note
                            award for the best stakes and binding, but also the Landscape Therapy Best Isle of Wight
                            Competitor award.</p>

                        <p>The three competitors in the novice class were all from the Isle of Wight, and the victorious
                            novice was Tod Carder of Hulverstone who comfortably defeated Tony Gillingham into second
                            place by six points.</p>

                        <p>The large team class attracted a lot of attention from the spectators, as with 14 workers on
                            a short stretch of hedge there was a lot to see. The winning team, the Tree Fellers, not
                            only took away the Landscape Therapy Trophy, but also the W Hurst &amp; Sons cup for the
                            best hedge laid with hand tools.</p>
