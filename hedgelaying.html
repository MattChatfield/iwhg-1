            </header>

            <p>
              Hedgelaying is the art of cutting a stem partly through so that
              it will bend without breaking and will continue to grow. The
              traditional way of managing hedges throughout large parts of
              England and Wales, hedgelaying was originally carried out to
              contain livestock, such as sheep and cows. Hedges are now
              primarily laid to enhance the appearance of the hedge and to
              maintain habitats for the birds, animals and flowers which so
              enrich our visits to the countryside.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hedgelaying involves cutting nearly all the way through the base
              of the stems and laying them over at an angle of about 35
              degrees. The cut stems, called pleachers, are tucked tightly
              together and lay parallel to each other. Generally, hedges are
              then staked vertically and bound horizontally for strength and
              to achieve the thickest possible hedge. The hedgelayer can work
              with both hand tools and chainsaws, and normally stakes and
              binds the hedge with hazel. Managed in this way, hedges can last
              indefinitely.
            </p>

            <h2>The origin of hedges and hedgelaying</h2>

            <p>
              Hedges in some form have existed as long as man has cleared
              woodland for agriculture. Documentary evidence proves that there
              were hedges in existence in AD 800 which can still be seen today
              in England. But the laying of hedges is more recent in origin,
              and is linked to the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">process of Enclosure</a>
              which transformed the English landscape throughout the Middle
              Ages. In 1603 the first Act promoting enclosure was passed, to
              be followed by over 5,000 separate Enclosure Acts enclosing over
              7 million acres of open fields or common land. Enclosure acts
              specified that the plots of land they created be enclosed by
              hedges and ditches and maintained by the owner subsequently.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Rackham">Oliver Rackham</a>
              estimates that over 200,000 miles of hedge were planted between
              1750 and 1850 and that this was as much as in the previous 500
              years. Modern hedgelaying dates from that time in the eighteenth
              century. The word ‘hedge’ derives from an earlier word meaning
              bank - the division between strips of land in the mediaeval
              farming system. After the Enclosure acts, each man had to dig a
              ditch to create a boundary, piling up the soil on his side and
              planting bushes on the soil to keep livestock on his land. This
              ‘dogging down and stocking up’ was hard work so, when creating
              boundaries, the ditch was often left out (unless drainage was
              needed). Bushes were still planted and even if there was no bank
              they kept the name they have today: a hedge.
            </p>

            <p>
              Planting 'on the flat', as opposed to setting the hedge on a
              bank, was rare before the 19th century. It first came into
              common local use in Yorkshire's Vale of Pickering where as early
              as 1785 hedges were made by digging a trench, setting the plants
              along the vertical side and then backfilling. But it was the
              advent of the railways which encouraged flat planting, for the
              engineers preferred their hedges unbanked and often unditched as
              well. Soon farmers in many areas adopted this practice, which
              was cheaper and often made for better growth. The old 'bank and
              ditch' was finally outmoded. Flat planting gradually evolved in
              its turn so that the most usual modern method is 'ditch and
              hedge'. In this method a ditch is dug beside the hedge and the
              hedge is planted on a bank which is so low as to be negligible
              compared to older banks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although some started calling for a reduction in the number of
              hedges even as enclosure was still taking place, on the grounds
              of efficiency, the number of hedges did not start to decline
              significantly until after the Second World War. In 1946 there
              were an estimated 500,000 miles of hedge in England.
            </p>

            <h2>The decline of the hedgerow in England</h2>

            <p>
              Hedgerows can only survive in the long term with correct
              management. Today, neglect and incorrect management are
              responsible for more hedgerow loss than outright removal, which
              is now less than new hedge planting.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is estimated that there were 352,000 miles of hedge in
              England and Wales in 1984. By 1990 this had fallen to 270,000
              miles and by 1993 to 236,000.
            </p>

            <h2>Resurgence of hedges and hedgelaying</h2>

            <p>
              Post-war agricultural policy changes gradually changed to
              reverse the loss of hedges through removal. A 1993 survey by
              CPRE revealed that far more hedges were being planted and fewer
              actively removed than for 1984-90. Hedgerow loss for the period
              1990-93 was almost entirely due to changes of management,
              including neglect. However, by the latter part of twentieth
              century the value of hedgerows was well established, perhaps
              best illustrated in the enacting of the
              <a href="http://www.naturenet.net/trees/hedgerow/index.html">Hedgerow Regulations 1997</a>
              which give statutory protection to a limited number of important
              hedgerows.
            </p>

            <p>
              The popularity of the craft of hedgelaying, perhaps not
              surprisingly, has mirrored the decline and rise of hedgerows
              throughout this time. This traditional country skill declined
              for much of the 20th century, and at one time looked as though
              it might even die out. However a revival in the late 20th
              century came from an influx of amateur hedgelayers who now keep
              the craft alive as a hobby, as well as a small but growing
              number of professionals who find their services in demand when
              landowners realise the aesthetic and historic value of a real
              laid hedge.

                  Hedges are laid in a variety of regional styles. The Isle of
                  Wight has its own style, which is now very rarely practised.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              In this style, the pleachers are laid fairly flat, to form a
              hedge roughly semi-circular in cross-section, about 3ft high and
              about 2ft wide. The pleachers are secured by crooks set on
              either side. Most laid hedges today on the Island are laid in South of
              England Style, including those laid during the IW Hedgelaying
              Competition.
