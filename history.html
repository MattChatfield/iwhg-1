							<h2>Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition: History</h2>
							<p>Including past competition information</p>
						</header>

						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/hedge_2013.jpg" alt="" /></span>

						<p>Each year, the Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group organises the Isle of Wight Hedgelaying
							Competition. A separate competition has been run by the <a target="_blank"
								href="https://www.facebook.com/wightnaturefundcharity">Wight Nature Fund</a> since 2024.
						</p>

						<h3>Early competitions</h3>
						<p>Years ago, the IW Hedgelaying Competition was run alongside the annual ploughing match. This
							tradition died out in the 20th century, most likely as the craft of hedgelaying began to
							wane and hedges were removed from fields across the country - including the Isle of Wight.
							This made suitable sites harder to find, and there were fewer practitioners of the
							craft.</p>
						<p>In the late 1990s a few enthusiasts on the Island decided to stage a hedgelaying competition
							again, the first for many years. This was held in 1998 at Chapel Furlong Farm, Hulverstone,
							by kind permission of Mr and Mrs Carder. It was supported by the Isle of Wight Council's
							Countryside Section, and by FWAG, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group. Both of these
							organisations have since wound up, but the hedgelaying competition lives on!</p>

						<p>Since then, the revived competition has been held (mostly) annually at various locations
							across the
							Island. </p>


						<h3>Details of past competitions</h3>
						<p>This is an incomplete list of competition results and reports. Photos are being added gradually, where we have them. Older competitions have little in our archive, so if you have any results or
							information about competitions prior to 2008 we would love to add them to these pages.</p>
