						<p>Each year, the Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group organises the Isle of Wight Hedgelaying
							Competition. A separate competition has been run by the <a target="_blank"
								href="https://www.facebook.com/wightnaturefundcharity">Wight Nature Fund</a> since 2024.

						<h3 id="early-competitions">Early competitions</h3>
						<p>Years ago, the IW Hedgelaying Competition was run alongside the annual ploughing match. This
							tradition died out in the 20th century, most likely as the craft of hedgelaying began to
							wane and hedges were removed from fields across the country - including the Isle of Wight.
							This made suitable sites harder to find, and there were fewer practitioners of the
							craft.</p>


						<p>By the 1980s there was interest growing in the craft of hedgelaying amongst
							conservationists and local communities, perhaps fuelled by the realisation that the last
							generation of farm workers who had actively practised the skill was fast dying out.</p>
						<p>There are records showing that the Isle of Wight Council's Countryside Management
							Service set up at competition starting in the early 1990s. We're not sure exactly when the
							first one was but In October 1991 Ian Rowat
							ordered stakes and heathers for 'This year's hedgelaying competition' from the Abbot
							brothers, and mentioned that the site was to be the Fighting Cocks, Arreton.</p>
						<p>An undated document of similar age shows the rules of the competition back then were
							not that different to the rules today.</p>

						<blockquote>The competition will actually start at 10am and 11 yards of hedging will be
							available to lay within a 5 hour time limit. Obviously to enable positions to be drawn from
							a hat and stakes and tools to be organised you will need to be on ground at 9.30am.
							All hedging stakes and heathers will be provided by C.M.S. Different length stakes have been
							supplied to allow different styles to be adopted. No style will be stipulated. The judges
							will be looking for well executed cuts on pleachers, the use and positioning of stakes and
							heathers and the overall finish of the hedge.
							Positions will be given for the first three places and prizes donated by W Hursts will be as
							follows:
							<ul>
								<li>1st prize £30 gift voucher for Hursts</li>
								<li>2nd prize £15 gift voucher for Hursts</li>
								<li>3rd prize £5 gift voucher for Hursts</li>
							</ul>
							Winners will expect to stay for the prize giving ceremony which will start at 4pm and to
							receive a hedge laying cup which will be returned for next years competition.
						</blockquote>

						<p>In 1992 we have a report that a competition was held, and there were five competitors. In
							1993, W Hurst & Sons become sponsors of the competition, a role they maintain for many
							years.
							In 1995, a competition was held at the Countryman Pub, Limerstone, and 244 people attended -
							as big a crowd as we sometimes see today! Also noted was the introduction of 'The Countryman
							Cup' for best novice. Prior to this there was only a single Open class of entry.
							Because our records are patchy, we don't have information about other competitions, although
							it seems likely that the competition was held annually through those years.

						<h3 id="iwhg">The Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group</h3>
						<p>In the late 1990s a few enthusiasts on the Island formed IWHG, the <a href="iwhg.html">Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group</a>, a group to promote hedges and hedgelaying, and agreed to stage the hedgelaying competition
						. The first IWHG-managed competition was held in 1998 at Chapel Furlong Farm, Hulverstone,
							by kind permission of Mr and Mrs Carder. It was supported by the Isle of Wight Council's
							Countryside Section (the successor body to the Countryside Management Service), and by FWAG,
							the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group. Both of these
							organisations have since wound up, but the hedgelaying competition lives on!</p>

						<p>Since then, the revived competition has been held (mostly) annually at various locations
							across the Island. </p>

						<p>This is an incomplete list of competition results and reports. Photos are being added
							gradually, where we have them. Older competitions have little in our archive, so if you have
							any results or
